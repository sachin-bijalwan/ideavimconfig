My take on how to manage ideavim shortcuts

# About
More about ideavim can be found [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim).

Intellij supports plethora of shortcuts which are very hard to remember and manage. With the introduction of ideavim its become very easy to map shortcuts into keys. I started mapping ideavim keys to shortcuts but soon I figured out even though I have added many shortcuts into my vimrc I remember very few of them. 

In order to remember more shortcuts easily I grouped my shortcuts within different starting keys. For example all navigation shortcuts will start with <leader>n, all editor shortcuts will start with <leader>e etc. This system creates a structure in the chaos which helps in easy learning.

Along with that I have provided proper documentation for all plugins which should be useful for everyone. 

Feel free to contribute and share any feedback on this.
